V8 
-------------------------
- Open source google javascript engine that implement ES xxxx
- is used by google chrome and nodejs
- underlying implemntation is c++ (reality c++ convert javascript to machine code)
- has some hooks and extension points where you can add you own c++ codes and exposed them via javascript.

nodejs
------------------------
**** nodejs =  javascript core + c++ core(v8 + c++ node libs)
**** event driven , non-bloking I/O model

How nodejs achieve async behaviour
---------------------------
Similar to how javascript behave asyn in browser
1. call stack in V8 recongnise async functions and handed over to libuv
2. libuv execute them in background
3. once task finish push event to "event queue"
4. "event loop" get event and send "callback fn" associated with event to V8 "call stack"
